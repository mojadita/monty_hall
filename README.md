!!! Monty Hall problem test.

This repository makes 1 000 000 000 tests of the Monty Hall
problem by using the proposed strategy by Montecarlo method
to approximate the probability of guessing the door with
the price, based on changing the guess, once the driver has
open the non prized door.

The program mh.c can be build by executing the following
command:

    make mh

and then executed with:

    mh

In case you get too long to run the number of tests, you can
reduce it by touching the `#define N` in the source file.
